# OS- Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator
```bash
The goal of the Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project was to provide a platform to simulate and compare various page replacement algorithms like FIFO, LRU, MRU, OPR using Python and Tkinter

The project was aimed at providing an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that can be used by students, researchers, and professionals to study and compare the performance of different page replacement algorithms.
```

## Features of the project
The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project comes with several features that make it a useful tool for studying and comparing different page replacement algorithms. Some of the important features of the project are:

- User-friendly Interface
- Multiple Algorithms:
  1.**FIFO** (First In First Out)  
  2. **LRU** (Least Recently Used)  
  3. **OPR** (Optimal Page Replacement) 
  4. **MRU** (Most Recently Used)  
- Real-time Simulation
- Interactive Bar Charts
- File handling as it saves results to a file : `page_replacement_results.txt`.

## **Requirements**
- **Python 3.x**  

### **Required Libraries:**
- **tkinter** (Usually pre-installed with Python)  
- **ttk** (Comes with tkinter)  
- **matplotlib**
